   setenv enable_margin_retrain 1
   setenv margin_threshold xx, xx is in half db, i.e., 10 means 5db.

Bugfixs:
1. New PDSP firmware that fix the F5 OAM cell loopback probelm in Cisco DSLAM.

Version 04.00.06.00

Version 04.00.04.00
-------------------
Features:
1. Added feature so OAM F5 ping will not require a corresponding PVC channel to
   be setup.
2. Added timeout value for F5 OAM ping. The new command are "exxxpyyycdzzzt" for
   end-to-end and "sxxxpyyycdzzzt" for segment. "zzz" is timeout value in milli-second.
3. Added proc entry "avsar_pvc_table" to record received VPIs and VCIs. The format is 
	vpi,vci
   seperated by new line. To search for PVCs, an application can do the following.
	i) Send a (or several) F5 OAM cell on a VPI/VPI pairs with command 
	   echo exxxpyyycd2t > /proc/sys/dev/dslmod
	ii) Wait >2ms or poll proc entry /proc/avalanche/avsar_oam_ping until the result
	   indicates a failure. (It will be failed all the time with 2ms timeout.)
	iii) Repeat above two steps for new VPI/VCI pairs.
      iv) Check proc entry /proc/avalanche/avsar_pvc_table any time for PVCs that responded.
  
Version 04.00.03.00
-------------------
Bug Fixs:
1. Fixed bug that caused crash when phone cable is unplugged.
2. Fixed LED operation for "flexible LEDs".

Features:
